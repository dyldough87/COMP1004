# Comp1004 code project

this code here is the project and website I been designing and working on for a very long time, it is a fitness tracker that enables users to track their own exercises throughout their duration and calories burned during their time working out, I have even implemented a graph to make it easier for a lot of users who prefer to see their progress visually. 

I am also keen to tell you about the BMI calculator that has been installed, I have made it so that all ages and genders have been included as I believe every user deserves a chance to be fairly measured and have an accurate scaling to their BMIs, this is all to promote a healthier lifestyle for the users who use my project.

I have also made it so that the user has no problem navigating my website with a simplistic UI as I account for all age groups and wish to make this as seamless for anyone who comes across it.
